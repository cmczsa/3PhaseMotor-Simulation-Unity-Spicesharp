# Introduction

Create a three-phase motor model and simulate its transient in Unity based on spice#.

All the code and packages are uploaded on 

__Google Drive__ (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/188zbhcGzTjfGYZjGA9DhB000N4QJaM8J?usp=share_link), for the whole project file is too large to upload on Github.

# Files And Scenes

## "ACMotor_viewScene" folder

This folder contains the scenes exported from Unity. 

1. "OnlyMotorView" folder shows the working scene of a three-phase AC motor. It's states are ploted in the meantime. 
Run .exe file to see the scene.

2. "ConveyorMotorView" folder shows the working scene of a factory, including a conveyor, motor, manipulator(__using RealVirtual.io package__). 
Run .exe file to see the scene.

## "ACMptor_Unity" folder

The __whole Unity project__, contains C# scripts, model files, Nuget packages and plugins. 

Two scenes "sampledemo", "game4automation" are exported as .exe files in "OnlyMotorView" folder.
